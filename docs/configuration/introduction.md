Miracle is configured via a `YAML` format. This section describes the settings that you may define in that file.

## File location
The configuration file will be written blank the first time that you start the compositor. The file is named miracle-wm.yaml and it is written to your config directory, most likely at:

```
~/.config/miracle-wm.yaml.
```

The configuration is in the `YAML` file format.
