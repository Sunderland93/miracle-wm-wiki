# Mir's Built-in Configuration

> Please note that Mir's built-in configuration **is distinct from the configuration defined in
> the [configuration section](file.md). The two may indeed overlap with one another. There is a task

Mir provides a built-in configuration on top of the one that miracle-wm defines.

## Location
This file can be found at:

```
.config/miracle-wm.config
```

or at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/miracle-wm.config` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is defined.

## Format
This configuration is in a typical key-value pair format, i.e.:

```
key=value
```

The list of valid `key`s can be found by running:

```
miracle-wm --help
```

The keys are the names of the commandline arguments

## Example

```
# ~/.config/miracle-wm.config

x11-window-title=miracle-wm
idle-timeout=600
display-config=sidebyside
add-wayland-extensions=zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1:zwp_input_method_v1

```
