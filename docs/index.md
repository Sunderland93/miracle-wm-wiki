# miracle-wm

miracle-wm is a Wayland compositor based on [Mir](https://github.com/MirServer/mir). It features a tiling window manager at its core, very much in the style of [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway). The intention is to build a compositor that is flashier and more feature-rich than either of those compositors, like [swayfx](https://github.com/WillPower3309/swayfx).
