# Roadmap
The goal is to have an environment that I am comfortable daily-driving by **July 2024**.

`0.x.0`.

The dates attached to these releases aren't set in stone. Any release may come
earlier if the work is done. Also, new features may be added to the release while it's
in progress if priority changes, which may push back the release date.
