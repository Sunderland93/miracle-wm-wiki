# Roadmap
The goal is to have an environment that I am comfortable daily-driving by **July 2024**.
This goal will be marked by the `1.0.0` release. Until then, all releases will be
`0.x.0`.

The dates attached to these releases aren't set in stone. Any release may come
earlier if the work is done. Also, new features may be added to the release while it's
in progress if priority changes, which may push back the release date.

- [ ] Stacking windows
- [ ] Support for i3 containers
- [ ] Pointer support for tiling actions
    - [ ] Drag tiles around
    - [ ] Resize tiles with pointer
- [ ] Animation
    - [ ] Closing windows
- [ ] Configuration
    * [ ] Display configuration (depends on https://github.com/mattkae/miracle-wm/issues/93)
- [ ] Full I3 IPC integration

## 1.0.0
**Official Release (Due October 15th)**

Features:

- [ ] Bug free
- [ ] Tons of test coverage
- [ ] **IDEA**: Workspace/window overview view (similar to GNOME)
- [ ] **IDEA**: Settings app
- [ ] **IDEA**: Context menu on window with support for actions
- [ ] **IDEA**: Focus mode, where the focused application appears up front and center
- [ ] **IDEA**: A minimal default shell, including a panel, launcher, background, etc.
- [ ] **IDEA**: "Freestyle tiling": This would mean that tiling can extend beyond the screen and that the screen can be navigated via scrolling, panning, or anchor points. Workspaces would still be available in this mode, although they would be less relevant.
- [ ] **IDEA**: Workspaces could be unified in one mega scrolling view to give the illusion of one continuous workspace with "sections"
